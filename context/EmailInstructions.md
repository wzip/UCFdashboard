As we discussed, Grace will be assisting with GIS needs for the UCF program.   One of the projects we discussed would be to make a data dashboard for the program to display a map of the townships of NJ.   There should be a search bar or pull-down menu to click through counties and then municipalities to display the township.    When you click on that township, we would eventually like the dashboard to pull from our database all information pertinent to that town e.g. plan status and expiration date, accreditation status, trained individuals, open grants, past grants etc.... 

I am currently starting the process to transition away from access to another program for these databases.   So, for now, I think the best thing would be to make this dashboard open up the individual townships accreditation report.   The reports can be found here:
https://www.nj.gov/dep/parksandforests/forest/urbanandcommunity/accreditation.html

As you can see the report is quite long and takes time to scroll through each one.   This PDF would need to be broken down to each individual municipalities report.   Clicking on the map for the municipality would open this report for now.    Since we have a history of reports on that page we could link the past reports as well for now.    Once we work through the databases to transition them, we could link open and past grants etc. as well.    

Since the report is open facing now there shouldn't be PPI concerns, but maybe once we include past and open grants we may need a sign in system in place.

Thanks for your support in helping us with this project with your new hourly!
